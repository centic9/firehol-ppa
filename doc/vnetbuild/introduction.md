Introduction
============

Who should read this manual
---------------------------

This is a reference guide with specific detailed information on
commands and configuration syntax for the VNetBuild tool.
The reference is unlikely to be suitable for newcomers to the tools,
except as a means to look up more information on a particular command.

For tutorials and guides to using FireHOL and VNetBuild, please visit the
[website](http://firehol.org/).

Where to get help
-----------------

The [FireHOL website](http://firehol.org/).

The [mailing lists and
archives](http://lists.firehol.org/mailman/listinfo).

The package comes with a complete set of manpages, a README and a brief
INSTALL guide.

Installation
------------

You can download tar-file releases by visiting the [FireHOL website
download area](http://firehol.org/download/).

Unpack and change directory with:

~~~~
tar xfz firehol-version.tar.gz
cd firehol-version
~~~~

From version 3.0.0 it is no longer recommended to install firehol by
copying files, since a function library is now used, in addition to
the scripts.

Options for the configure program can be seen in the INSTALL file and by
running:

~~~~
./configure --help
~~~~

To build and install taking the default options:

~~~~
./configure && make && sudo make install
~~~~

To not have files appear under /usr/local, try something like:

~~~~
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
make
make install
~~~~

If your O/S does not usually have a `/usr/libexec`, you may want
to add `--libexecdir=/usr/lib` to the `configure`.

Packages are available for most distributions and you can use your
distribution's standard commands (e.g. aptitude, yum, etc.) to install
these.

> **Note**
>
> Distributions do not always offer the latest version. You can see what
> the latest release is on the [FireHOL website](http://firehol.org/).
