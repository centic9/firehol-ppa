# NAME

firehol-version - set version number of configuration file

<!--
contents-table:helper:version:keyword-firehol-version:N:*all forbidden*:Specify a version number for the configuration file.
  -->

# SYNOPSIS

version 6

# DESCRIPTION

The `version` helper command states the configuration file version.

If the value passed is newer than the running version of FireHOL
supports, FireHOL will not run.

You do not have to specify a version number for a configuration file,
but by doing so you will prevent FireHOL trying to process a file which
it cannot handle.

The value that FireHOL expects is increased every time that the
configuration file format changes.

> **Note**
>
> If you pass version 5 to FireHOL, it will disable IPv6 support and
> warn you that you must update your configuration.
