FireHOL

    FireHOL, an iptables stateful packet filtering firewall for humans!
    FireQOS, a TC based bandwidth shaper for humans!

Upgrade Notes
=============
From version 2.0.0-pre6, FireHOL adds combined IPv4/IPv6 support within
a single configuration.

If you are upgrading FireHOL from a version earlier than 2.0.0-pre6,
please read the [upgrade notes](http://firehol.org/upgrade/).


Installation
============
If you are installing the package from a tar-files release, FireHOL uses
the GNU Autotools so you can just do:

~~~~
./configure
make
make install
~~~~

To not have files appear under /usr/local, try something like:

~~~~
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
make
make install
~~~~

If your O/S does not usually have a `/usr/libexec`, you may want
to add `--libexecdir=/usr/lib` to the `configure`.

You can get help on the options available (including disabling unwanted
components) by running:

~~~~
./configure --help
~~~~

From version 3.0.0 it is no longer recommended to install firehol by
copying files, since a function library is now used, in addition to
the scripts.


Getting Started
===============
Configuration for FireHOL goes in `/etc/firehol/firehol.conf`
Configuration for FireQOS goes in `/etc/firehol/fireqos.conf`

In the examples directory, you can find examples for both programs.

To start the programs:

~~~~
firehol start
fireqos start
~~~~

For more details on the command-line options, see the man-pages:

~~~~
man firehol
man fireqos
~~~~

Read the [tutorials](http://firehol.org/tutorial/) on the website for
more information and to learn how to configure the programs.

For detailed information on the configuration files, read the manual
online, or start with these the man-pages:

~~~~
man firehol.conf
man fireqos.conf
~~~~

You may want to ensure that FireHOL and FireQOS run at boot-time. If you
installed from an distribution package this will be configured in the
usual way.

For a tar-file installation, the binaries can often be linked directly
into `/etc/init.d`, since their options are SysVInit compatible. Some
example systemd service files can be found in the contrib folder.


Support and documentation
=========================
The main website is [http://firehol.org/](http://firehol.org/).

To ask questions please sign up to the
[mailing list](http://lists.firehol.org/mailman/listinfo/firehol-support)

Man pages, PDF and HTML documentation are provided as part of the package
and can be found in the tarball or in your distribution's standard locations
(e.g. `/usr/share/doc`). The [latest manual](http://firehol.org/manual/)
is also online.

The site has a [list of all services](http://firehol.org/services/) supported
by FireHOL "out of the box" as well as information on adding new services.
