DOCUMENTATION
-------------
If you received this program in as a RPM, documentation should be
installed at /usr/share/doc/firehol-X.XX.
Otherwise, documentation should be available in the doc/ directory
of the .tar.bz2 archive you received.

In any case, you can also find the documentation online, at:

                     http://firehol.sf.net


INSTALLATION
------------
To make FireHOL start at boot time you have to add it to the startup
procedure of your operating system.

Three things are needed to start FireHOL properly:

1. Move firehol.sh to the directory where your startup scripts exist
   and rename it to firehol (i.e. remove the .sh).

2. Make sure FireHOL is called with something like:

         /path/to/startup/scripts/firehol start

3. Make sure there is a valid configuration file in
   /etc/firehol/firehol.conf

This is it.


IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
If you decide to use FireHOL regularly (or permanently) you have to
understand that it will control your firewall and therefore be a
key point of your security. You should do something to be notified
of bugs or other kind of problems as soon as they appear.

I suggest to subscribe to the notification engine of freshmeat.net
under this project or to monitor FireHOL's file releases at
sourceforge.net. Both of these services will keep you anonymous
(to me) but will update you if and when new releases become available.
