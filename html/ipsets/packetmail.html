<p>This IP list includes IP addresses that have been detected performing TCP SYN to 206.82.85.196/30 to a non-listening service or daemon. No assertion is made, nor implied, that any of the listed IP addresses are accurate, malicious, hostile, or engaged in nefarious acts. Use this list at your own risk.</p>

<strong><big>This IP list may suffer from poisoning!</big></strong><br/>
<p>Since the maintainers do no verification at all on the received SYN packets, anyone can easily send spoofed SYN packets to 206.82.85.196/30 to have any IP he/she likes listed!</p>
<p>Ideally they should have be using <a href="https://github.com/ktsaou/firehol/wiki/Working-with-SYNPROXY" target="_blank">SYNPROXY</a> to verify the source IP addresses of packets.</p>
