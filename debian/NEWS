firehol (1.296-1) unstable; urgency=low

  For this release, the list of reserved ips data file RESERVED_IPS is no more
  mandatory. That will render FireHOL easier.
  get-iana (a script for updating the list of reserved ips) is no more available
  system wide.
  To ease the transition, while the existing RESERVED_IPS and RESERVED_IPS.old
  files in /etc/firehol are preserved at pre-installation stage with the extra
  extension .dpkg-bak, the upstream updated get-iana.sh script was put in
  /usr/share/doc/firehol/examples, alog with a minimal version of RESERVED_IPS
  for who may still need them.

firehol (1.256-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This release reverts the split from firehol into firehol-wizard,firehol and
  the lib. That will make updates much easier in the future.
  get-iana (a script for updating the list of reserved ips) is now available
  you can run it regulary to update your ip list. Its recommended to install
  the aggregate package to aggregate the ip ranges from the iana.
