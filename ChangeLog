    - tproxy now uses markdef() to allocate a mark
    - save marks.conf only after successful firewall activation
    - drop requirement for awk (other programs still use it)
    - add log() and loglimit() helpers to allow logging from ipsets globally
    - prevented backup of all the ipsets in memory - it takes too long
      when the system has many ipsets installed
    - rewrote the ipsets functionality so that:s
      - it optimizes netsets with iprange if present
      - it adapts the maxelem parameter for the updated ipset so that
        updating ipsets with big incremental updates does not fail
      - maintains compatibility with older ipset versions
        (side-effect: calling an ipset update without restarting the
         firewall now only support ipsets that are used in firehol.conf)
      - if iprange is present, processing of ipsets is a lot faster
